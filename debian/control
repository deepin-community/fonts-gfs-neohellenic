Description: modern Greek font family with matching Latin
 Neohellenic is a Greek font family characterized by round, even pen
 strokes. It consists of several weights (normal, italic, bold, and
 bold italic) as well as a Latin version.
 .
 Former Greek types had harked back to classical models. In 1927,
 Victor Scholderer chose instead to revive one which had first
 appeared in a 1492 printing of Macrobius attributed to Joannes
 Rubeus. In 1993-4 the typeface was digitized by the Greek Font
 Society, with the addition of a new set of epigraphic symbols.
